By default, tailspin will open a file in the pager less. However, if you pipe something into tailspin, it will print the highlighted output directly to stdout. This is similar to running tspin [file] --print.

To let tailspin highlight the logs of different commands, you can pipe the output of those commands into tailspin like so:

cat /var/log/syslog | tspin
kubectl logs -f pod_name | tspin

tailspin uses less as its pager to view the highlighted log files. You can get more info on less via the man command (man less) or by hitting the h button to access the help screen.
Navigating

Navigating within less uses a set of keybindings that may be familiar to users of vim or other vi-like editors. Here's a brief overview of the most useful navigation commands:

    j/k: Scroll one line up / down
    d/u: Scroll one half-page up / down
    g/G: Go to the top / bottom of the file

Follow mode

When you run tailspin with the -f or --follow flag, it will scroll to the bottom and print new lines to the screen as they're added to the file.

To stop following the file, interrupt with Ctrl + C. This will stop the tailing, but keep the file open, allowing you to review the existing content.

To resume following the file from within less, press Shift + F.
Search

Use / followed by your search query. For example, /ERROR finds the first occurrence of ERROR.

After the search, n finds the next instance, and N finds the previous instance.
Filtering

less allows filtering lines by a keyword, using & followed by the pattern. For instance, &ERROR shows only lines with ERROR.

To only show lines containing either ERROR or WARN, use a regular expression: &\(ERROR\|WARN\).

To clear the filter, use & with no pattern.

Settings:
-f, --follow                     Follow the contents of the file
-e, --start-at-end               Start at the end of the file
-p, --print                      Print the output to stdout
-c, --listen-command [CMD]       Listen the output (stdout) of the provided command
    --config-path [PATH]         Use the configuration file from the provided path
    --words-[COLOR] [WORDS]      Highlight the provided words with the given color
    --disable-builtin-keywords   Disable the highlighting of all builtin groups
    --disable-booleans           Disable the highlighting of booleans and nulls
    --disable-severity           Disable the highlighting of severity levels
    --disable-rest               Disable the highlighting of REST verbs
